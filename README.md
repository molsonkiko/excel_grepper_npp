# Notepad++ Excel grepping tool
Tired of people responding *Why would you use Notepad++ to view Excel files? They're binary!* when you ask about using Notepad++ with Excel? Well, now you can (sort of) read Excel files in Notepad++!

The user interface is VERY SIMPLE (because I didn't feel like making something fancier).

There is also a CLI tool that just prints JSON to the terminal. It has the same options as the Notepad++ add-in shown below.
